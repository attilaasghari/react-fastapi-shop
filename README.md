Here’s a polished **README.md** draft for **react-fastapi-shop**, plus a few questions so I can tailor it better if needed.

# React-FastAPI-Shop

An **online store** web application built with **React** (frontend) and **FastAPI** (backend). Created as a university project, the app demonstrates a full-stack architecture: product listing, cart functionality, user interactions with REST APIs, etc.

## Requirements

Make sure you have installed:

* **Python** (3.8 or newer recommended)
* **Node.js** / **npm** (or Yarn)
* Git

---

## Environment Variables

You may need to set certain environment variables in the backend (and sometimes frontend) depending on configuration. Common ones:

| Variable       | Purpose                                                                |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `DATABASE_URL` | Path / connection string to the database (if not using default SQLite) |
| `CORS_ORIGINS` | Allowed origins for frontend requests                                  |
| `SECRET_KEY`   | For any authentication / encryption (if used)                          |

---

## Getting Started

Here’s how to run the project on your local machine:

1. **Clone the repo**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/attilaasghari/react-fastapi-shop.git
   cd react-fastapi-shop
   ```

2. **Backend setup**

   ```bash
   cd backend
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   If needed, set up `.env` or environment variables.

3. **Frontend setup**

   ```bash
   cd ../frontend
   npm install
   ```

---

## Running Locally

* **Start the backend**

  From `backend/`:

  ```bash
  uvicorn app.main:app --reload
  ```

* **Start the frontend**

  From `frontend/`:

  ```bash
  npm run dev
  ```

* Open your browser at the address shown (usually `http://localhost:3000`) to view the app.

---

## Building & Deployment

For production, you’ll want to build the frontend and configure the backend to serve the static files, or deploy frontend separately (e.g. on Netlify, Vercel) and backend on a server or cloud platform.

```bash
# Frontend build
cd frontend
npm run build
```

Then configure serving of `frontend/dist` from backend or host elsewhere.

---

## Usage

* Browse available products
* Add items to cart
* Adjust quantities / remove items
* (If implemented) Place orders or simulate checkout

---

## Future Improvements

Here are some ideas for enhancements:

* User authentication (signup/login)
* Order history & user profiles
* Admin panel for product / order management
* Improved styling & UX
* Switching to a more robust DB (e.g. PostgreSQL or MySQL) for production
* Unit & integration tests
